## TODO

- formControl
- Instead of string for shape format, an enum would be a good idea
- Add bootsrap for buttons and stuff
- I should put each shape type in a separate component. Would reduce the number of cases and increase scalability

### Prioritized low:

- Pretty styling - not great at it and incredibly creative to be honest. Hopefully having a UI/UX expert mitigates this.
- Screen adaptability - we don't aim projects for mobile devices use AFAIK?
